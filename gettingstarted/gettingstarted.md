#Getting Started with Machine Learning
If you are just getting started with Machine Learning things can get to be a bit tricky. Here are some resources to get you started. For me knowing where to get started and how to learn data science was the hardest part. 

##Advice 
Start small. Often people ask me how to get started and I have the following advice on a workflow that worked for me to get started. 

1. Make sure you are familiar with basic statistics 
2. Work on cleaning data 
3. Load your data into R or Python
4. Create visualizations 
5. Start to model and learn about different methods. From there start to experiment until things start to make sense.

Here are a few articles to get you started that discuss the current state of field and introduce some key concepts:
