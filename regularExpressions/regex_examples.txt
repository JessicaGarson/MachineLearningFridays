Time for some Regular Expressions!

Let's deal with letters, spaces, and characters first:

Here are some you probably already know! Who knows they mean? Who knew they were regex!?
\n
\t

Space, newline, tab:
\s
\n
\t

Find one letter at a time:
\w
[A-z]

Find any sequence of letters:
\w+

Find a literal character:
\",

Find literal characters, in any order:
[",]

Find capital or lowercase letters only:
[A-Z]
[a-z]

Find words starting with a capital letter:
[A-Z]\w+

Put a restriction on number of letters:
[A-Z]\w{2}\s

What if you don't want to replace the space? Use Grouping!
    Group with parentheses:
    w+(\s)
    [A-Z]\w{2}(\s)

    Now, catch your group:
    SomethingNew$1

You can narrow the letters you're searching for, like this:
[A-Ca-c]

Find a specific word:
\bHorace\b

Now let's take a look at numbers:

Find one digit at a time:
\d
[0-9]

Find any sequence of numbers:
\d+
